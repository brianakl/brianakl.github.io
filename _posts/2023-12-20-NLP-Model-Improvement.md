- Developed an academic machine learning replication paper that improved upon and scrutinized a state-of-the-art model's performance on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset.
- Conducted comprehensive analysis on over 570,000 SNLI instances, identifying and addressing challenging cases that caused model errors, demonstrating strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
- Implemented advanced NLP techniques to enhance model robustness:
   - Fine-tuning
   - Adversarial training
   - Ensemble methods
- Successfully outperformed the results reported in the original paper being replicated, showcasing ability to innovate and improve upon existing research.


## Technologies
- Executed the project using a robust tech stack:
   - Python
   - PyTorch
   - Hugging Face Transformers
   - NVIDIA CUDA for GPU acceleration
